# Sematic challange 1

## Homework challange 1

I was placed on this project to make the file more semantic

- i was motivated to learn what differnt elemates are out there and witch ones work best in this file "for me anyway"
- i build this project to learn how read files and learn how they work
- i solved one issue with the file where i seen the link portion on one of the buttons was not working properly.
- i learned you have to take your time working on these files 

## Credits
On a discord a class mate pointed out the issue with the link, i didnt fix the link in that moment but i did go back and did see what she was talking about
